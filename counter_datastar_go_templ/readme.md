## Counter sample using htmx + go + templ

A minimal implementation of a counter using [htmx](https://htmx.org/), [go](https://go.dev), and [templ](https://templ.guide/).

<br/>

### Usage

Use `./run.sh` to have it started in "dev mode" (it is restarted on detected code/file changes).

-   This requires `air` tool installed. Look into the script for installation details.
-   For further development, `templ` CLI is needed (to regenerate Go files from templ files)
